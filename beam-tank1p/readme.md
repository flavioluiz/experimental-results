tank filling ratio: 100 % filled

total weight = 4924.6,4924.9

measures were made using frequency sweep excitations.
two kind of excitations were used: symmmetric and assymetric ones
(with a 180degrees phase difference between each input voltage)

two inputs: 1- upper piezoelectric patch;
            2- lower piezoelectric patch;
two outputs:1- upper tip accelerometer;
            2- lower tip accelerometer;

charge amplifier setting: 
  1000 mV/(ms^-2), 0.2Hz lower filter, 0.1kHz up. filter


 results uses input range +- 5 V
