tank filling ratio: 34.8 cm / 47 = 0.7404

total weight = 3838.1,3837.8, 3836.9

measures were made using frequency sweep excitations.
two kind of excitations were used: symmmetric and assymetric ones
(with a 180degrees phase difference between each input voltage)

two inputs: 1- upper piezoelectric patch;
            2- lower piezoelectric patch;
two outputs:1- upper tip accelerometer;
            2- lower tip accelerometer;

charge amplifier setting: 
  1000 mV/(ms^-2), 0.2Hz lower filter, 0.1kHz up. filter
  (tests on ..._0p5V folder used 316mV/(ms^-2), with +-0.5V input range in simulink
  but results had more noise than before!!!)

  other results uses input range +-10 V or +- 5 V
